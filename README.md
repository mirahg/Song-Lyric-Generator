# Song-Lyric-Generator
## Final Project for CS4120 at Northeastern University

### Mirah Gordon, Albert Zhang, Henry Stachowiak

Final project utilizing Python libraries (NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn, Sci-kit Learn, Tensorflow, and Keras) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to employ a song lyric generator.

This project attempted to create an NLP powered piece of art, specifically song lyrics. It comapred outputs from an online text generator, InferKit [https://app.inferkit.com/demo] and our own neural network. 

The song data was sourced from MusicOSet [https://marianaossilva.github.io/DSW2019/index.html#downloads], which provided an enhanced data set and included pre-processed and labeled song lyric features.

One jupyter notebooks contain all the necessary code for this project:

* Books_Mongo has code for loading in data with MongoDB and cleaning data into an exportable form for Neo4j.

Other documents included in this repository are the the necessary text and csv files for running the notebook and the final project report that was submitted.
